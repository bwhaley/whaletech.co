About two months ago [I wrote about](https://www.whaletech.co/2014/07/06/freelance.html) the  beginning of my freelance journey. I officially started consulting on August 1st so I have just a little over a month under my belt. Time for an update.

## Work
August filled up quickly with a variety of engagements: a technical project to design a move from Heroku to AWS for an exciting startup in San Francisco, a [talk at Intuit](https://speakerdeck.com/bwhaley/mobile-scale-aws) on the topic of scaling with AWS, and product design, marketing, and architecture for a startup in the south bay. I was fully booked all month and it really didn't take much effort.

But as I've been warned, the flood dried up quickly. In September I don't have any projects in the pipeline yet, save for [ongoing educational projects with Pearson](http://techbus.safaribooksonline.com/search?q=%22Ben%20Whaley%22). I'm trying not to twiddle my thumbs.

I'm not too nervous about this, actually. August was a busy month, and I didn't get much time to think about what I *really* want to focus on in consulting. Part of the motivation was to have a little more freedom to spend time outside, cooking meals, enjoying a somewhat less structured life. Plus I still have part time work with Anki to fill up a few days a week and provide a base level of income.

Of course, too many months of this will become a problem.

## Nooks and Crannies
In the last post I mentioned that I need to find an accountant and a lawyer. I, uh, did neither.

 I ended up using [FreshBooks](http://www.freshbooks.com/) for simple accounting. It's not perfect, but it took less than 10 minutes to get create an account, set up clients, create projects, log time, and create an invoice. At $20/mo I'll take it until it doesn't suit my needs. Yay for SaaS.


Legal stuff I basically sidestepped by working as a 1099 contractor. Yes, I should set up an LLC. No, I probably won't actually do it until I need to. I must have a high risk tolerance or something, but until I have an employee, I don't really see the point of paying for legal services.

## Setting goals
Short term:

* Bill at least one new client in each of September and October
* Attend 3 meetups around Berkeley & SF
* Business cards
* Go for a mtn bike ride at Joaquin Miller in the middle of the week

Mid term:

* Continue to refine core competencies in to distinct, clear service offerings
* Identify and evaluate ideas for a software project, probably open source, and probably released as a hosted pay-as-you-go service.

That doesn't seem like too much. Very doable.
