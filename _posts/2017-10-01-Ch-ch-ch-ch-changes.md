The last three years have been quite the ride, but now, like all good things, WhaleTech is coming to an end. I'm thrilled to be joining [Kountable](https://www.kountable.com), an innovative trade finance startup based in San Francisco, as Director of Security and Operations.

WhaleTech marked three years in business this past August. The time flew by. Some numbers:

- 20 clients
- 8 subcontractors
- 27 completed vulnerability assessments
- 19 AWS migrations & projects
- 5 countries visited on client business
- [1 book published](https://www.amazon.com/UNIX-Linux-System-Administration-Handbook/dp/0134277554/)

I'd like to express my appreciation for the clients, partners, subcontractors, friends, family, and others who supported WhaleTech. I received nothing but encouragement from the very beginning, and for that I'm deeply grateful.

If everything is going so well, why the change? Perhaps unsurprisingly, there's not a simple answer. I miss the camaraderie of a startup team creating an exciting product. I believe that it's important to change it up to avoid going stodgy and stale. Perhaps most imporantly, I believe in Kountable's mission, and I have the opportunity to have a real impact. I can't pass that up, and I couldn't be more excited about the opportunity. If you want to join in on the fun, I'd love to hear from you.

I intend to maintain this blog. So until the next post, keep on keepin' on.

Ben
